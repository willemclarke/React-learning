## Following tutorial by IPenywis youtube video

- Access the video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd7S4qTibzQ&feature=youtu.be
- Github repo: https://github.com/ipenywis/React-Weather-App

* Sidenote, my version used a different api (openweathermaps) as the API used in the video no longer offers the forecast get request on a free subscription... thus some of the codebase is different and the final result has differing weather icon images. Next step is to redo this project from scratch with Typescript and try refactor whole codebase.
